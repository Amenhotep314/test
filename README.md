# Random Things
This is the place I put random mini-projects that haven't yet earned their own repos.

## Projects
 - [Hydrogen](./hydrogen.ipynb): A hardcoded solver to sample from the wavefunctions for the ground and first two excited states of the neutrally charged hydrogen atom. Rescaling constants are eliminated here, such that, for example,
   - $\Psi_{1, 0, 0}(r, \theta, \phi) = e^r$
   - $\Psi_{3, 2, 2}(r, \theta, \phi) = r^2 e^{-r/3} \sin^2\theta e^{2i\phi}$
